## **CanvasImage Watermarking App**
This program is a simple GUI application built with Python's tkinter and PIL libraries that allows a user to choose an image and watermark it. The watermark used is the text "Watermark" in red color and Arial font. The program opens a file dialog window for the user to select the image they want to watermark. After the image is selected, it is displayed on a canvas with the watermark in the lower-right corner.

## **Usage**
To use this program, you can run the CanvasImage.py file from the command line or your IDE. A window will open with a button labeled "Choose Image." Clicking this button will open a file dialog where you can select the image you want to watermark. Once an image is selected, it will be displayed on the canvas with the "Watermark" watermark in the lower-right corner.

## **Customization**
You can customize the program by modifying the watermark text, color, and font. You can also modify the layout of the GUI, such as changing the size of the canvas or the position of the button.
